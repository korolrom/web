**The second release of i-PI is ready for download. Several new features including replica exchange molecular dynamics, instanton calculations, perturbed path integrals and open path integrals have been implemented and merged to the master branch in the [official i-PI repo](https://github.com/i-pi/i-pi).
The release is accompanied by the publication of a [reference paper on Computer Physics Communications](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2018.09.020), that constitutes the new default reference to acknowledge use of this release.
Please let us know if you find any remaining bug so that we can polish the release further!**



i-PI is a universal force engine interface
written in Python, designed to be used together with an ab-initio (or 
force-field based) evaluation of the interactions between the atoms. 
The main goal is to
decouple the problem of evolving the ionic positions to sample the
appropriate thermodynamic ensemble and the problem of computing the
inter-atomic forces.

</p>

The implementation is based on a client-server paradigm, where i-PI
acts as the server and deals with the propagation of the nuclear
motion, whereas the calculation of the potential energy, forces and
the potential energy part of the pressure virial is delegated to one
or more instances of an external code, acting as clients.

i-PI is free software, distributed under a dual MIT/GPLv3 licence. You
